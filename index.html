	<h3><p>My name is Paul Vitely-Chow and when I was about 5 years old my mother was given a computer as a gift from my grandfather. I remember helping her open up the box and watching her set it up on the desk.
	Once it was set up she taught me some basic functionality and I was instantly hooked. The more I used it the more I loved it. It made me want to learn everything about computers.
	It even spawned a dream of having one for my own. It took until I was 15 to complete that dream. I remember working extremely hard at a landscaping job for an entire summer.
	Even though it was hard work I knew it was going to be worth it at the end. Once I finally gathered enough funds I taught myself how to build a computer and I built it.
	The moment my computer ran properly I knew I wanted to do something in IT. Thanks to NPower I'm now learning a lot about the IT industry and I'm looking forward to being apart of it.<p></h3><h1> <!-- The paragraph with border stuff -->
